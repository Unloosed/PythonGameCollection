# Game Menu

This project is a simple game menu built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to select and start different games from a graphical interface.

## Features

- **House Escape**: A thrilling escape game.
- **Snake**: The classic snake game.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Unloosed/PythonGameCollection.git
    cd PythonGameCollection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the game menu:
```bash
python main_GUI.py
```
